Create a model to predict student loan repayment.

We were given a scenario stating that I work at a company that specializes in student loan refinancing. If the company can predict whether a borrower will repay their loan, it can provide a more accurate interest rate for the borrower. My team has asked you to create a model to predict student loan repayment.

Based on the provided csv file and data processing information, I am to decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a model that will predict the likelihood that an applicant will repay their student loans. 

To complete this task, I prepared the data for use on a neural network model using pandas and sci-ket learn's standard scaler to scale the features data.

I then compiled and evaluated my model using a neural network.  From that information I was abel to predict loan repayment success.

I wrapped up the exercise by discussing what features I would include in a recommendation system for student loans, the type of model I would use, and challenges that I would need to account for in building this system.
